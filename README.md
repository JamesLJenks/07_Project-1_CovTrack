# Project-1_CovTrack

CovTracker utilizes the user's IP address to access their current location and display the current number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the user's country, as well as allowing the user to search the running numbers elsewhere in the world and compare them. The last searched country will be saved in the user's local storage for ease of comparison in the future. 

Everyone has been impacted by Covid-19 in some capacity; with that in mind, we set out to design an easy to use resource where end users have instant access to the current Covid-19 numbers in any country, without the additional fluff and bias of news outlets.

CovTracker was developed utilizing UI Kit and Jquery libraries, as well as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
